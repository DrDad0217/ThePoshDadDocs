#Outlook 

- Notifications work in the web app
- Display desktop alert is checked under File ↪ Options ↪Mail
- Focus assist is turned off
- Banners are enabled
- Notifications turned on in Windows
- Added new mail profile for Sara and got the notifications to work for a split second and then broke again.
- The notification shows up in the notifications tab but does not actually pop up in the bottom right hand corner
- When clicking in and out of the notification it goes away entirely. 
- Signed on to my account on the users machine and had no issues with notifications
- Sara tried a different computer but the notifications still were not working.
