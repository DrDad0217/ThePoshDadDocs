Timmi is having issues when searching with the **Current Folder** indexing option


**Troubleshooting**

1. Ran quick repair
2. Unchecked the Outlook indexing option under **File** -> **options** -> **search** -> **indexing options**
3. Unchecked quick searching asking Outlook to search all items(Rechecked)
4. Rebuilt the indexing by going to **File** -> **options** -> **search** -> **rebuild**
5. Changed the search option in **File** -> **options** -> **search**  and switched to _Include results only from_: Current Folder. It was set to search the entire mailbox when searching from the inbox. 

Step five seemed to resolve the issue.
