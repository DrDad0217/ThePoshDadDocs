# User Separation Script

#### Time Spent Creating Script : 3HRS
#### Script Creation Date 5/2/22

Since created, the user separation script has been ran 142 times, on average I would say the script saves about 5-7 minutes of a technicians time. I will be subtracting the time spent creating the script below to give a better estimate of time saved.

Low Average Time Saved

- 710  - 180 = 530 Minutes
- 11.8 - 3 = 8.8 Hours

High Average Time Saved

- 994 - 180 = 814 Minutes
- 16.5 - 3 = 13.5 Hours

This is a guess but looking at the pay cap for our position I would put the average hourly wage for our position at about $41hr

Low Average Money Saved

- $369

High Average Money Saved 

- $553.50


# Desktop Drive Space 

With VPD/VFD having many shared devices they would have constant calls come up about the C: drive getting full. To remedy this there were a few things over time I created.

This is a form I created allowing the technicians to remove Windows profiles from remote computers.

After looking into the issue more we noticed that the .PST files were the real culprits taking up most of the space. I created a script and worked with Kev to remove .PST files from remote computers. 

We have two collections specifically involving disk space 

- Low Disk Space < 10GB
- Low Disk Space < 35GB

Prior to the script being ran we had about 80 machines in the **35GB** collection and about 50 machines in the **10GB** collection. Looking at the collections at this moment the numbers had been immensly reduced.

- Low Disk Space < 10GB is down to 9 machines 
- Low Disk Space < 35GB is down to 36 machines

 I was very happy to see how many machines were knocked out of both of these collections, I imagine this helped prevent a good amount of calls from coming in.


## Transitioning

My last accomplishment would be transitioning into VPD, the city has layers upon layers of things to learn and I feel I have handled transitioning into VPD pretty well. I still have a long way to go in terms of learning the ins and outs but I am happy with the progress I have made.


# Goals For Next Year

-  Complete the **Comptia Network + Certification Course** 
-  Continue to increase my expertise in the VPD department
-  Build solidified relationships with the VPD deparment 


## Bonus Goals

- Increase team productivity with more Powershell scripts
- Enhance/Train my troubleshooting skills
- Practice my writing skills for communication with users
